To filter users based on email, age, and then get the counts for `total_users_by_gender` and `users_by_gender_this_month`, you can extend the existing logic to allow filtering based on those additional parameters while still calculating the counts grouped by gender and based on the current month.

We’ll adjust the `/user_count_by_gender` endpoint to accept query parameters for filtering (`email` and `age`). Then we’ll modify the query to filter users based on these values before counting them by gender and month.

### Steps:
1. **Accept Filter Parameters**: We'll allow the user to specify `email` and `age` as optional query parameters to filter the users.
2. **Apply Filters**: We'll use these parameters in the SQLAlchemy query to filter the users.
3. **Calculate Counts**: After applying the filters, we'll calculate the total number of users by gender and the number of users created in the current month, still grouped by gender.

### Key Changes:
1. **Email and Age Filters**:
   - The `email` and `age` filters are received as **optional query parameters** from the request. If provided, they will filter the users.
   - `email = request.args.get('email')` gets the `email` filter, and `age = request.args.get('age', type=int)` gets the `age` filter (converted to an integer if present).
   
2. **Query Modification**:
   - The query starts with selecting the data for counting users and calculating the number of users created this month (`total_users_count`, `users_created_this_month`).
   - We apply filters conditionally:
     - If `email` is provided, we filter by `User.email == email`.
     - If `age` is provided, we filter by `User.age == age`.
   
3. **Result Construction**:
   - We iterate through the query results using the same approach (`row[0]`, `row[1]`, `row[2]`), which correctly maps the `gender`, `total_users_count`, and `users_created_this_month`.

### Example Usage:

1. **Inserting Users**:
   Let's first insert users into the database. Example:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/insert_user \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "gender": "Female", "email": "alice@example.com"}'

   curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/insert_user \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"name": "Bob", "age": 25, "gender": "Male", "email": "bob@example.com"}'

   curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/insert_user \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"name": "Charlie", "age": 30, "gender": "Male", "email": "charlie@example.com"}'
   ```

2. **Querying Users by Gender with Filters**:
   Now, you can filter users by `email` or `age` by passing them as query parameters. For example:

   - Get users with a specific email:

   ```bash
   curl "http://127.0.0.1:5000/user_count_by_gender?email=alice@example.com"
   ```

   - Get users filtered by `age`:

   ```bash
   curl "http://127.0.0.1:5000/user_count_by_gender?age=30"
   ```

   - Get users filtered by both `email` and `age`:

   ```bash
   curl "http://127.0.0.1:5000/user_count_by_gender?email=alice@example.com&age=30"
   ```

3. **Expected Response**:
   For a request like the one above, the response would look like:

   ```json
   {
       "total_users_by_gender": [
           {"gender": "Female", "count": 1},
           {"gender": "Male", "count": 2}
       ],
       "users_by_gender_this_month": [
           {"gender": "Female", "count": 1},
           {"gender": "Male", "count": 2}
       ]
   }
   ```


If the `email` filter is provided in the request, the query will still be considered as a **single query** because it is part of the original query construction. In SQLAlchemy, when you apply a `filter()` (or multiple filters) to a query, it modifies the original query without triggering a new one unless you explicitly issue a separate `db.session.query()` or perform a separate database operation.

### Explanation:

In the code:

```python
# Start the query and apply filters based on query params
query = db.session.query(
    User.gender,
    func.count(User.id).label('total_users_count'),
    func.sum(
        case(
            [
                (
                    (func.extract('month', User.created_on) == current_month) &
                    (func.extract('year', User.created_on) == current_year), 1
                )
            ],
            else_=0
        ).label('users_created_this_month')
    )
)

# Apply filters if provided
if email:
    query = query.filter(User.email == email)

if age:
    query = query.filter(User.age == age)

query = query.group_by(User.gender).all()
```

1. **Single Query Construction**:
   - When `query = db.session.query(...)` is called, you're building a single SQL query.
   - The `filter()` calls (like `query.filter(User.email == email)`) are applied to **this single query**.
   - SQLAlchemy **builds a single SQL query** by modifying the original query with the filters.
   - The filters (`email` and `age`) are **part of the same query**, so they don't trigger separate database calls.

2. **Single Query Execution**:
   - When you call `.all()` on the query (`query = query.group_by(User.gender).all()`), this triggers **one single query execution** to the database.
   - The query will fetch the count of users by gender, considering the filters (`email` and `age`) and the `case()` logic for the current month.
   - **No additional queries are triggered** unless explicitly instructed.

### Example SQL Query:

If the `email` filter is passed, the query might be translated to something like this (in PostgreSQL, for example):

```sql
SELECT 
    gender, 
    COUNT(id) AS total_users_count, 
    SUM(
        CASE 
            WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created_on) = 1 AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_on) = 2025 THEN 1 
            ELSE 0 
        END
    ) AS users_created_this_month
FROM user
WHERE email = 'alice@example.com'  -- Applying email filter
GROUP BY gender;
```

### Key Points:

- **Single Query**: The query construction with `filter()` ensures that the filtering conditions are incorporated into a **single SQL query**. This is the same SQL query sent to the database regardless of whether `email` or `age` is provided.
- **Efficiency**: No matter which filter is applied (`email`, `age`, or both), SQLAlchemy still constructs and executes **one single SQL query** with the necessary filters.
- **Performance**: This approach avoids multiple queries, which improves performance compared to making separate queries for each filter.

### To Summarize:

If you provide the `email` filter, it will still be treated as **one single query**. Only one query will be executed, with the filter applied to the `WHERE` clause of the SQL query. There is no second query unless you explicitly perform another query in the code.

Let me know if you need further clarification!

### Conclusion:
- This updated code allows you to filter users by `email` and `age` while still calculating the total number of users grouped by gender and the number of users created in the current month.
- The query dynamically adjusts based on the provided filters, making it flexible and efficient.
