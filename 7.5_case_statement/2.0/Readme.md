Yes, it's absolutely possible to merge both counts (`total_users_by_gender` and `users_by_gender_this_month`) into a single query, thus reducing the overall time complexity by executing just one query to gather both the total count and the monthly count of users by gender.

We can achieve this by using **conditional aggregation**. Here's how we can structure the query:

### Approach:
1. **Count Total Users by Gender**: This will be done using a `CASE` statement inside an aggregate function (`COUNT`).
2. **Count Users Created in the Current Month by Gender**: We'll use the `CASE` statement with a condition to check if the user's `created_on` date is within the current month and year.

### Optimized SQL Query:
Instead of running two separate queries, we'll create a single query that counts:
- The **total number of users by gender**.
- The **number of users by gender created in the current month**.

### Merged Query Using SQLAlchemy:

Hereâ€™s the updated Flask code with a single query to handle both requirements:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from sqlalchemy import func, case
from datetime import datetime

app = Flask(__name__)

# Configure the database URI (using SQLite for simplicity)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///users.db'
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False

# Initialize the SQLAlchemy object
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

# Define the User model
class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
    age = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=False)
    gender = db.Column(db.String(10), nullable=False)
    created_on = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"<User(id={self.id}, name={self.name}, age={self.age}, gender={self.gender}, created_on={self.created_on})>"

# Initialize the database (run this once to create the tables)
@app.before_first_request
def create_tables():
    db.create_all()

# Route to insert a new user
@app.route('/insert_user', methods=['POST'])
def insert_user():
    data = request.get_json()
    
    # Ensure all required fields are provided
    name = data.get('name')
    age = data.get('age')
    gender = data.get('gender')
    
    if not name or not age or not gender:
        return jsonify({"message": "Missing required fields: name, age, gender"}), 400
    
    # Create a new user and add to the session
    new_user = User(name=name, age=age, gender=gender)
    db.session.add(new_user)
    db.session.commit()
    
    return jsonify({"message": "User created successfully", "user_id": new_user.id}), 201

# Route to get count of users by gender and count of users by gender created in this month
@app.route('/user_count_by_gender', methods=['GET'])
def user_count_by_gender():
    # Get the current date and month
    current_date = datetime.utcnow()
    current_month = current_date.month
    current_year = current_date.year

    # Corrected query with case() statement fixed
    query = db.session.query(
        User.gender,
        func.count(User.id).label('total_users_count'),
        func.sum(
            case(
                [
                    (
                        (func.extract('month', User.created_on) == current_month) &
                        (func.extract('year', User.created_on) == current_year), 1
                    )
                ],
                else_=0
            ).label('users_created_this_month')
        )
    ).group_by(User.gender).all()

    # Prepare the result, ensuring we're using the correct label names
    result = {
        "total_users_by_gender": [
            {"gender": row[0], "count": row[1]} for row in query
        ],
        "users_by_gender_this_month": [
            {"gender": row[0], "count": row[2]} for row in query
        ]
    }

    return jsonify(result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

```

### Key Changes:
1. **Conditional Aggregation**:
   - The query uses `CASE` inside `SUM` to count users created in the current month. We use the `func.extract()` method to extract the `month` and `year` from the `created_on` field and compare them with the current month and year.
   
2. **Single Query**:
   - The query is grouped by `User.gender` and counts both:
     - The **total users by gender** (`total_users_count`).
     - The **users created in the current month by gender** (`users_created_this_month`).

3. **Efficiency**:
   - This reduces the time complexity to **O(n)** because the entire count of users (by gender and by gender for the current month) is done in a single pass over the data, rather than executing two separate queries.

### Explanation:
- **`func.count(User.id)`**: Counts the total number of users for each gender.
- **`func.sum(case(...))`**: The `CASE` expression checks whether the `created_on` timestamp matches the current month and year. If it does, it adds 1 for that user to the `users_created_this_month` count.
- **`func.extract('month', User.created_on)`**: Extracts the month from the `created_on` timestamp of each user.
- **`func.extract('year', User.created_on)`**: Extracts the year from the `created_on` timestamp of each user.

### Example Response:

When you send a GET request to `/user_count_by_gender`, the response might look like this:

```json
{
    "total_users_by_gender": [
        {"gender": "Male", "count": 10},
        {"gender": "Female", "count": 8},
        {"gender": "Other", "count": 2}
    ],
    "users_by_gender_this_month": [
        {"gender": "Male", "count": 3},
        {"gender": "Female", "count": 1},
        {"gender": "Other", "count": 0}
    ]
}
```

### Breakdown of the Response:
- **`total_users_by_gender`**: Contains the total count of users for each gender.
- **`users_by_gender_this_month`**: Contains the count of users created in the current month, grouped by gender.

### Steps to Test:
1. **Insert Sample Data**:

You can insert a few sample users into the database:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/insert_user \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "gender": "Female"}'
```

2. **Query the User Count**:

Make a GET request to `/user_count_by_gender` to get both the total count and monthly count of users by gender:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/user_count_by_gender
```

### Conclusion:
By merging both the total user count by gender and the user count by gender created in the current month into a single query, we've optimized the performance and reduced the complexity to a single database round-trip. The use of conditional aggregation with `CASE` expressions is the key to making this efficient.
