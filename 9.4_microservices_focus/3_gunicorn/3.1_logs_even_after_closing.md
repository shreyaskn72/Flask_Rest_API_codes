You're running your Flask app with Gunicorn in the foreground (attached to your terminal), so **pressing `Ctrl + C` stops Gunicorn** because it sends an interrupt (`SIGINT`) signal.

If you want **Gunicorn to keep running after you close the terminal or press Ctrl+C**, here are your options:

---

## ✅ Solution 1: Run Gunicorn in the Background

Just add `&` at the end to run it as a background process:

```bash
gunicorn crud:app \
  --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 \
  --workers 2 \
  --access-logfile - \
  --error-logfile - \
  --log-level debug \
  2>&1 | tee logs/gunicorn.log &
```

> This lets the command run in the background, but **it will still stop if the terminal session closes**.

---

## ✅ Solution 2: Use `nohup` to Keep It Running After Logout/Disconnect

This makes the process **immune to hangups (e.g., terminal closing)**:

```bash
nohup gunicorn crud:app \
  --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 \
  --workers 2 \
  --access-logfile - \
  --error-logfile - \
  --log-level debug \
  > logs/gunicorn.log 2>&1 &
```

> This will **run Gunicorn detached from the terminal** and output logs to `logs/gunicorn.log`.

---

## ✅ Solution 3: Use `tmux` or `screen` (Recommended for Dev)

Start a persistent terminal session:

```bash
tmux
```

Then run your Gunicorn command as usual. You can detach from the session with `Ctrl + B`, then `D`. Your process continues running. To reattach:

```bash
tmux attach
```

---

## ✅ Solution 4: Use a Process Manager for Production (e.g. `supervisord`, `systemd`)

For **production deployments**, consider a full process manager like:

* `supervisord`
* `systemd`
* Docker
