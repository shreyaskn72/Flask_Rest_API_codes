# Flask API with Error Handling Example

This repository contains a Flask API application demonstrating error handling for various types of exceptions, including database errors using SQLAlchemy.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- SQLAlchemy


## curl Example Request for api

```curl
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/add_item \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"name": "Example Item", "quantity": 5}'
```


### Error Handling

The API handles specific errors and returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages. Detailed error handling includes:

- IndexError 
- KeyError 
- ValueError 
- TypeError 
- SQLAlchemyError
- UnicodeError 
- AttributeError 
- Additionally, a generic error handler catches any other unhandled exceptions and logs them.

### Logging

Errors and exceptions are logged to the console using Python's logging module. This aids in debugging and monitoring the application.

### Notes
Replace the dummy database operations (session.add(item), session.commit(), etc.) in app.py with your actual database logic.
Adjust the logging level (logging.ERROR) in app.py for production deployments to suit your logging requirements.



### Explanation:

This `README.md` focuses specifically on the API endpoints provided by the Flask API application. It covers the following key aspects:

1. **Requirements**: Lists the required software and packages needed to run the Flask API application.


2. **curl Example Request for api**: Example request of the `/api/add_item` endpoint

3. **Error Handling**: Overview of specific error handlers implemented for various types of exceptions, ensuring proper handling and response codes (`400` for client errors, `500` for server errors).

4. **Logging**: Mentions the use of Python's `logging` module to log errors and exceptions to the console, aiding in debugging and monitoring.

5. **Notes**: Additional notes and considerations for customizing the application, such as replacing dummy database operations with actual database logic and adjusting logging levels for production environments.

This `README.md` provides a concise and informative guide specifically focused on the API endpoints of the Flask API application, making it easier for users and developers to understand and utilize the provided endpoints effectively. Adjust the content as per your specific application's features and requirements.
